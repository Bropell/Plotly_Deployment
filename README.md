# Plotly Deployment
The purpose of this repository is to provide a visually appealing panel for demographic information
and bacterial data for each volunteer in a study about belly button bacteria. The user can select a 
test subject from a drop down menu and changes will be implemented on the page. The demographic information 
for that particular subject will be displayed under the dropdown menu, the top ten bacteria cultures 
found in that subjects belly button will be displayed in a horizontal bar graph, the weekly washing
frequency is displayed in a gauge chart with colored intervals, and lastly the bacteria cultures per
sample will be displayed in a bubble chart on the bottom of the page with varying bubble sizes based
on the sample values.
